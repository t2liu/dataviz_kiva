**Women and loan requests** 

Goal: Visualize how much women request for loans compared to men. To understand: Why Don't Women Ask For More Money?

When people at Kiva noticed that women generally ask for less when they apply for Kiva loans, we thought it would be interesting to interact with this data as a visualization. The project objective is to demonstrate that women ask for less money in Kiva loans, and how trends amongst gender groups have changed over the years.
